Part I
Let's start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.

Create a local repository and add and commit some files
- mkdir test
- cd test
- touch first.txt
- git init
- git add first.txt
- git commit -m 'adding first.txt'
Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote
- git remote add test_git git@github.com:kennywhwu test.git
- git push -u test master
Fork the repo https://github.com/rithmschool/git_practice - clone it and submit a pull request
Create a new branch locally and push it to GitHub
- git checkout -b new_branch
- git push test new_branch
Submit a pull request with your new branch against the master branch on the git_practice repo.
Part II - Command Line Murder Mystery
If you have gone through our Terminal and UNIX course, take the time to combine your knowledge of the Terminal, Git, and GitHub to complete a murder mystery! You can find the exercises here. Fork and clone the repository and try to solve the mystery!
